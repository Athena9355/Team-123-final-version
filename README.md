### Brainstorm
1. dessert
2. game
3. study website
4. **reading / book-related website**
5. travel website
6. music-related (build playlists etc.)

### Project Description
Objection: Our project is a great resource for people who love reading. They can come to our website to get book recommendations, learn about different genres of books around the world, and even input books they like. This has a real world help because it can be used in schools and libraries, even regarding Del Norte. 

Sponsor: We will be using Del Norte English teach ----- as our sponsor. We chose this person because she is a good example of the perfect client that we would want to use our project. It is meant for the usage of English classes and we would love to get input from her on what to improve and place on our website. 

### Project Plans/Ideas/Wires
Project Plans: The goal of our website is to assist people in reading and enjoying reading. As a result, we plan in integrating a few technicals into our project to achieve our goals. We plan on including the following:
1. book suggestion generator: the generator will either generate a suggestion randomly or allow the user to use a filter function to find a suggestion
2. comment forum and rating system: we want to allow the users to leave comments and ratings on the books they read.
3. music suggestion: we will suggest songs that go with the book if the user enters information on the book (i.e. title, genre, author etc.)
4. games: we will include a few simple games to allow the user to take a break from reading and relax
5. calendar system: the calendar system will help the user create a reading plan. The user can enter the date by which they would like to finish a book, the system will create a calendar that displays the chapters that the user need to finish in order to meet the goal.
6. Create personality test --> give book suggestions based on the result of the test.

notes/feedback from crossover team:
from our discussion, the cross over team suggested that we can have a code for specific classes
discussion board: give sub divisions. have subdivisions for each separate questions. have ways to organize 
pop quizzes: crowd sourcing for that. engage students to have them come up with questions for each chapter. have the students turn in their questions to mr west
maybe allow the music to play it on the website (can embed spotify on the website)
