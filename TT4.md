## Topics and Purpose
To assist in understand search and procedures, this Tech Talk will be focused on Database CRUD and Search as used in this CSP course project.
<ol> 
    <li> Python Class, Procedures (aka def) and Objects will be illustrated in Database definition, queries, and search </li>
    <li> JavaScript Procedures (aka function) will enable pass user input to search, also JavaScript will present return values (JSON) as a result  </li>
    <li> SQLAlchemy framework and libraries provides standards for Developing Class and Procedures for a Database </li>
    <li> SQL Query with "Order By" will return ordered lists which can be used to perform binary search </li>
</ol>


## Code Table
The CRUD Blueprint is a collection of Python and HTML files.  These files are a used to support Frontend (HTML, JavaScript) and Backend (Python, SQLALchemy).  Together these files allow user to store and retrieve data.
